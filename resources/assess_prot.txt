SEMI-STRUCTURED ORAL INTERVIEW (SSOI) ASSESSMENT SPECIFICATION
1. ASSESSMENT GOAL Shift evaluation from "Usage" (knowledge of rules) to "Use" (real-time communicative competence). The report must identify the student’s "Linguistic Ceiling"—the point where cognitive load exceeds linguistic resource.

2. THE WLP (WARM-UP, LEVEL-UP, PROBE) ARCHITECTURE The agent must categorize segments of the transcript into these three functional phases:

Warm-Up (A1-A2): Simple, formulaic questions (e.g., name, origin, hobbies).

Indicator of Success: Immediate response, high accuracy in present simple.

Level-Up (B1-B2): Narrative and Descriptive tasks (e.g., "Tell me about your last trip," or describing a visual prompt).

Indicator of Success: Use of past/future tenses, relative clauses, and cohesive devices (e.g., "because," "after that").

Probe (C1+): Abstract, hypothetical, or opinion-based questions (e.g., "How will AI change education?").

Indicator of Success: Use of conditionals, complex modals, and abstract vocabulary.

3. EVALUATION DOMAINS & RATING LOGIC For each domain, use a 1-5 scale based on the following specific markers:

A. Interaction and Fluency

Low (1-2): Passive; waits for prompts; frequent long pauses (>3 seconds).

High (4-5): Proactive turn-taking; uses "Repair Strategies" (e.g., circumlocution: "the thing you use to open doors" instead of "key").

B. Grammatical Accuracy and Range

Global Errors: Errors that "crash" the communication (e.g., wrong tense that obscures the timeline).

Local Errors: Syntax "glitches" that don't stop understanding (e.g., missing 3rd person 's').

Complexity Check: Does the student use "Nested Logic" (complex sentences/relative clauses) or only "Linear Logic" (SVO)?

C. Lexical Resource (Vocabulary)

Precision: Does the student use specific terms (e.g., "urbanization") or "Generic Objects" (e.g., "stuff," "things," "very big")?

Appropriacy: Is the register correct for the context?

D. Coherence and Discourse

Organization: Does the student link ideas with "Logical Operators" (e.g., "however," "consequently," "therefore")?

4. ANALOGY FRAMEWORK (FOR USER FEEDBACK) To bridge the gap for the learner, map linguistic failures to programming concepts:

Syntax Error: Small grammatical slips (Local Errors).

Logic Error: Misunderstanding the prompt or failing to convey the intended meaning (Global Errors).

Refactoring: Expanding basic vocabulary into more efficient, precise terms.

Memory Leak: Excessive hesitation or losing the thread of the conversation.

5. REPORT TEMPLATE REQUIREMENTS Every report MUST include:

Ceiling Identification: State exactly where the student struggled (Warm-up, Level-up, or Probe).

Evidence-Based Observations: Every claim must be followed by a student quote.

Actionable Roadmap: Provide two "Debug" priorities and one "Optimization" exercise.
