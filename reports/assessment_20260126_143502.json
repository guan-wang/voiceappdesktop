  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 (Elementary) level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, specifically when the student was asked to share details about a memorable trip and engage with the hypothetical question about receiving money. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 4 out of 5. The student's fluency was generally good with little hesitation during the Warm-Up phase. They responded adequately and engaged in turn-taking. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. Coherence suffered in responses to deeper questions. The lack of logical connection made the overall narrative difficult to follow. \nI recommend starting with the The student should start at the A2 module focusing on practical conversation skills, including asking and answering questions related to personal experiences and preferences. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Use of future tense and clarity of intent (e.g., \"스타트업 후 하고 싶어요\" is unclear). 2. Lack of specificity in vocabulary (e.g., instead of \"따뜻한 나라,\" use specific country names such as \"태국\", \"베트남\" etc.). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement \"Picture Narration\" exercises to encourage descriptive language use and coherence. Students could describe images of various locations or activities to build detail and narrative skills. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
