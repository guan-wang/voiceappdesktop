  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 (Elementary) level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred in the Level-up phase, primarily during the request for more detailed narrative structure (e.g., sharing a memorable hobby). \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 4 out of 5. The student demonstrates proactive turn-taking and maintains a steady pace with minimal pauses. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to link sentences with logical connectors, impacting overall coherence. \nI recommend starting with the A2 - Communicative Activities module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Grammatical Accuracy (Global Error): Improve the use of verb forms and sentence constructs to enhance clarity. For instance, using correct verb forms when describing their hometown (\"하르빈이 중국 도시에요\" should be grammatically solid). 2. Lexical Precision: Shift from generic vocabulary (e.g., \"그곳에 대해\") to more specific terms that can provide a clearer picture (e.g., \"풍경,\" \"문화\"). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Engage in Picture Narration exercises. This involves describing an image related to a hobby or experience, encouraging the student to form coherent narratives and practice using diverse vocabulary and grammatical structures. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
