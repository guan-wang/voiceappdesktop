  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-up phase, where the student struggled to provide coherent descriptions and narratives. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 3 out of 5. Generally clear pronunciation, but some hesitations impact clarity and smoothness of speech. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. Ideas are presented but lack logical connections or development, particularly when attempting to describe experiences. \nI recommend starting with the Module focused on developing narrative skills (e.g., Storytelling Techniques). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Consistency in tense usage, particularly differentiating between past and present narratives. 2. Expanding vocabulary to include more specific terms related to personal interests (e.g., skiing). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement Shadowing Exercises focusing on narratives, where the student listens to and mimics conversations describing experiences to improve fluency and coherence. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
