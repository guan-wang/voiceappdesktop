  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-up phase when the student struggled to provide detail and coherence in response to descriptive prompts. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is generally clear, but minor errors can cause misunderstandings. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The responses lack clear cohesion, making it difficult to follow the narrative thread of the conversation. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on 'Descriptive Language and Cohesion.' module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Misuse of noun forms and sentence endings (e.g., confusion between '할빈' and '하얼빈'). 2. Ability to expand on responses; transitioning from simple sentences to compound forms would enhance communication. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Shadowing Exercise - The student should listen to and repeat structured descriptions in Korean to improve fluency and vocabulary usage. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
