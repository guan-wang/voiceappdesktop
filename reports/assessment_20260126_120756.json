The breakdown occurred during the Probe phase when asked to share a specific experience related to skiing (Evidence: \"몰라요\"). \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is coherence with a rating of 3 out of 5. Basic coherence in listing hobbies but failed to connect ideas during deeper conversations. An area to focus on is lexical, rated at 2 out of 5. Used basic vocabulary without much elaboration or specificity. \nI recommend starting with the Entry to a Lexical Development module focusing on specific vocabulary enrichment beyond basic terms. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Misuse of possessive pronouns in sentences (\"제 구형이 하빈이에요\"). 2. Introducing more complex phrases for elaboration and description (\"스키 정말 좋아요 너무 너무 인기에요\" is vague). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Picture Narration exercises to enhance descriptive language skills and coherence. \nYou're making good progress!
