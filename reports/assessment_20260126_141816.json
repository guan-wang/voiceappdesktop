  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, particularly in providing detailed responses and using complex sentence structures. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is mostly clear, with minor lapses. The fluidity of speech generally aligns with expected A2 benchmarks, making communication largely effective. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. Responses tend to be disjointed; the student struggles to connect ideas cohesively in more complex answers, leading to an unclear message. \nI recommend starting with the Module 2 (Basic Speaking Skills: Developing Simple Conversations) module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Sentence structure (Global Error): The need to clarify sentence subjects and phrasing—for example, “고향은 하르빈이에요” should more appropriately be “제 고향은 하르빈이에요” for clarity. 2. Lack of detail and complexity (Global Error): Encourage the use of more descriptive phrases, such as avoiding vague terms like “비치랑” in favor of “해변으로 친구들과 갔던 기억이 납니다.”], 3. optimization_strategy 4. Engage in Shadowing exercises where the student mimics native speakers in various contexts, helping to improve fluency and sentence structure in real-time speaking scenarios. This can enhance fluidity and help with complex sentence formation. 5. Starting Point: Module 2 (Basic Speaking Skills: Developing Simple Conversations), 6. Complete the assessment: Use two \"Debug\" priorities and one \"Optimization\" exercise. 7. Debugging Priorities: 1. Sentence structure (Global Error): The need to clarify sentence subjects and phrasing—for example, “고향은 하르빈이에요” should more appropriately be “제 고향은 하르빈이에요” for clarity. 2. Lack of detail and complexity (Global Error): Encourage the use of more descriptive phrases, such as avoiding vague terms like “비치랑” in favor of “해변으로 친구들과 갔던 기억이 납니다.” \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Engage in Shadowing exercises where the student mimics native speakers in various contexts, helping to improve fluency and sentence structure in real-time speaking scenarios. This can enhance fluidity and help with complex sentence formation. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
