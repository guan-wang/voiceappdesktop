  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase when asked to elaborate on their favorite hobby. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is clear with minor mispronunciations that do not obstruct understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The responses lack logical connectors and cohesive structure, especially during deeper questions where more complex responses are necessary. \nI recommend starting with the Module 2: Basic Narrative Skills and Vocabulary Expansion. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Use of incomplete sentences during the Level-Up phase (e.g., \"수용은...\" without concluding the thought). 2. Lack of specific terms for hobbies (e.g., \"풀 보디 웰카우트\" instead of using \"수영은 전신 운동입니다.\" / \"Swimming is a full-body workout.\"). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a \"Storytelling\" exercise where the student practices expanding on a given topic with prompts, encouraging the use of logical connectors and narrative structure. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
