  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2/Novice High level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The linguistic ceiling appears during the \"Level-Up\" phase. This is where the breakdown in communication is first evident, particularly in the narrative and descriptive task. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 3 out of 5. Some hesitation and delays, requiring repetition and rephrasing for understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The user seldom uses logical connectors to link thoughts and ideas, affecting flow \nI recommend starting with the Level A2 Module focusing on narrative-building and expanding vocabulary. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Tense Usage: Apparent confusion in tense as seen in \"안 몰라요. 안 가봤어요.\" - similar to a Logic Error where a function fails due to incorrect sequence logic. 2. Use of Specific Terms: Initially refers to the place name correctly but fails to elaborate on concepts; akin to using a 'Generic Object' instead of specific class attributes. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Engaging in \"Picture Narration\" exercises where the student can describe scenes or actions in a more structured manner, allowing for practice with complex sentence formation and logical connectors. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
