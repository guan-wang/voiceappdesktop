  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase when tasked with describing feelings and reasons (struggling to provide detail about skiing). \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation was clear and understandable throughout the interview. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student's ideas were difficult to connect logically during the last question, lacking the ability to expand. \nI recommend starting with the Descriptive Language module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Expanding expressions to describe feelings or preferences in sport—moving from \"really good\" to more specific comparisons or explanations. 2. Utilizing conjunctions and more complex phrases to create longer and coherent explanations. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Introduce a \"Feelings & Reasons\" exercise where the student practices describing personal preferences using prompts, encouraging them to expand their thoughts similar to refactoring code for better performance. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
