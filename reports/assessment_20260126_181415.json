  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 (Lower Pre-Intermediate) level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase when the student struggled to elaborate on more complex ideas and experiences. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. The student's pronunciation was generally clear, with minor interference that did not impede understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The responses often lacked cohesion, particularly in linking ideas, which affected the clarity of the narrative when discussing travel experiences. \nI recommend starting with the Module focused on Narrative Skills and Expanded Vocabulary (A2/B1) module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Lack of detail in responses—needs development of circumlocution strategies to express thoughts when specific vocabulary is missing. 2. Confusion in logical coherence when shifting topics—practice linking phrases and ideas more explicitly. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement Picture Narration exercises wherein the student describes a series of images to encourage fluent storytelling and the application of more descriptive vocabulary in context. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
