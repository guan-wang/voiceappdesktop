  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-up phase. The breakdown occurred in the Level-up phase when the student struggled to provide a longer and more detailed response to the question about their most memorable winter experience in Harbin. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 4 out of 5. The student responded quickly to straightforward questions and maintained a good flow during simpler prompts. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 3 out of 5. Most ideas were connected, but the lack of detailed elaboration hindered coherence in more complex responses. \nI recommend starting with the Module 2: Expanding on Ideas module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Tense Consistency: The student needs practice in using the correct tense for narratives (e.g., past tense for past events). Evidence: Confusion in tense during responses about past events (\"하르빈은 중국 도시에요\" instead of \"하르빈은 중국 도시에 있었다\"). 2. Specific Vocabulary Usage: The student should work on expanding vocabulary to avoid generic terms. Evidence: Use of \"장소 많아요\" could be more specific (e.g., \"아이스 스케이팅장과 눈썰매장이 있어요\"). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a Descriptive Role-Play exercise where the student describes personal experiences, focusing on using appropriate tenses and vocabulary expansion. This will help them practice structuring longer responses and enhance coherence. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
