  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2/B1 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, specifically when the student was asked to elaborate on their skiing experiences. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Phonology is relatively strong, with clear pronunciation that generally supports comprehension, although minor lapses in fluidity are evident during hesitations. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles with coherence in responses that require more than a straightforward answer. This deficiency is most apparent when trying to elaborate on experiences or memories. \nI recommend starting with the Module 2—Basic Experiences (focus on past tense narratives and descriptive tasks). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Difficulty with narrative coherence and elaboration—focus on linking phrases and structure in responses. 2. Hesitant responses indicate a need for practicing fluency in retelling experiences. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a 'Storytelling Workshop' activity, where the student practices recounting personal experiences, with a focus on using transitions, descriptive vocabulary, and grammar appropriate for past narrative structures. This could involve peer discussions or guided role-plays to enhance fluency and coherence. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
