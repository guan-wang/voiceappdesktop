  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, specifically when asked to describe a recent enjoyable experience. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is clear, with minor issues that do not impede communication. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggled to organize thoughts when asked for a detailed experience. This led to confusion. \nI recommend starting with the Module focused on narrative skills and vocabulary expansion (e.g., descriptors for activities). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Difficulty in responding to descriptive prompts (e.g., providing details of an experience). 2. Hesitation that disrupts conversational flow (e.g., waiting too long before speaking). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Shadowing exercises focusing on response techniques for narrative prompts can help improve fluency and build confidence in descriptions. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
