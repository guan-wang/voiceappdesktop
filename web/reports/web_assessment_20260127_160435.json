  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2-B1 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled with more complex narrative structures. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Generally clear pronunciation with minor native influence that doesn't hinder understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 3 out of 5. The student presents ideas in a linear fashion but struggles with linking ideas coherently when prompted for depth. \nI recommend starting with the Module 2 (Basic Conversation Strategies: Expanding responses) module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Lack of complex sentence structures (e.g., relative clauses). 2. Insufficient specificity in vocabulary choices. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Shadowing exercise focusing on past tense narratives and linking phrases to enhance coherence and fluency in storytelling. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
