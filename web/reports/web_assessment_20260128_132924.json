  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase when the student was asked to elaborate on their coding project, leading to a lack of response (\"안몰라요\"). \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is generally clear, but there may be minor issues with fluency in longer responses. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to connect ideas logically when asked to elaborate, resulting in a disjointed response. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on expanding vocabulary and complex sentence structures (e.g., B1 level). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Verb Form Usage: The student needs to practice using the correct verb forms in context, especially in past and future tenses. 2. Specific Vocabulary: The student should work on using more precise terms instead of vague expressions (e.g., replacing \"자전거 수영해요\" with \"자전거 타는 것과 수영하는 것\" for clarity). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement \"Shadowing\" exercises where the student listens to and repeats complex sentences to improve fluency and grammatical accuracy. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
