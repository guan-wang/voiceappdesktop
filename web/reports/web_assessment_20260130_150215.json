  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The student struggled during the Level-Up phase when asked to elaborate on their experiences, indicating a lack of comfort with more complex narrative tasks. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 3 out of 5. The student demonstrates moderate fluency but hesitates when asked to elaborate on experiences, leading to longer pauses. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student has difficulty organizing thoughts coherently when prompted to provide more detail, leading to fragmented responses. \nI recommend starting with the Basic Narrative Skills module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Expand vocabulary to include more descriptive terms for experiences. 2. Practice forming complex sentences to improve narrative coherence. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Engage in Picture Narration exercises to encourage detailed descriptions and improve fluency. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
