  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A1 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to expand on their answers and engage in more complex dialogue. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation was clear and understandable, with no significant issues in phonetic delivery. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggled to connect ideas and provide detailed responses, leading to abrupt ends. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on expanding responses and using descriptive language (A2 level). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Lack of elaboration in responses (e.g., \"추워요\" instead of discussing activities in cold weather). 2. Limited vocabulary range; encourage the use of more specific terms instead of general phrases. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement \"Picture Narration\" exercises where the student describes images in detail to practice elaboration and vocabulary expansion. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
