  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to provide a detailed narrative about a hypothetical situation. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is generally clear, with only minor issues that do not impede understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student's ideas are sometimes disjointed, particularly when attempting to elaborate on more complex topics. \nI recommend starting with the Level-Up tasks, emphasizing narrative and descriptive skills. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complex Sentence Structures: The student should practice using relative clauses and cohesive devices to enhance narrative flow. 2. Specific Vocabulary Use: Encourage the student to replace vague terms with more precise vocabulary to improve clarity and engagement. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement Shadowing exercises where the student listens to and repeats complex sentences from native speakers to improve fluency and grammatical accuracy. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
