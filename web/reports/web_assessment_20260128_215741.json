  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A1 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to provide detailed responses. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation was generally clear, but there were no complex sounds or intonation patterns to assess. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 1 out of 5. The student failed to connect ideas or provide coherent responses during the Level-Up phase, leading to a breakdown in communication. \nI recommend starting with the The student should enter a beginner module focusing on basic conversational skills and vocabulary expansion. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Response Expansion: The student needs to practice elaborating on simple answers to avoid one-word responses. 2. Tense Usage: The student should work on using past and future tenses to provide more context in their answers. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a Shadowing exercise where the student listens to simple dialogues and repeats them, focusing on expanding responses and using varied vocabulary. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
