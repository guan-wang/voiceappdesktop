  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to provide a detailed narrative about their hiking experiences. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation was clear, and the student was easily understood. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggled to connect ideas and provide a coherent narrative in response to prompts. \nI recommend starting with the The student should enter a module focused on narrative skills and descriptive language (e.g., Module on \"Describing Experiences\"). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complex Sentence Structures: The student should work on using more complex sentences to enhance narrative quality. 2. Detail Expansion: Encourage the student to elaborate on their experiences with specific examples and descriptive language. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a \"Picture Narration\" exercise where the student describes a series of images related to hiking, encouraging them to use varied vocabulary and complex sentences. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
