  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A1 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, specifically when asked to describe a personal experience. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation was generally clear, with no significant issues affecting understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggled to connect ideas or elaborate on responses, resulting in a lack of coherence in longer answers. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on narrative skills and past tense usage. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Inability to elaborate on personal experiences (e.g., \"최근에 자전거 탔을 때 어디에 갔는지...\"). 2. Lack of complex sentence structures (e.g., not using past tense or relative clauses). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement 'Picture Narration' exercises where the student describes a series of images to practice past tense and elaboration skills. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
