  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown in communication occurred during the Level-Up phase, particularly when the user was asked to elaborate on their experiences riding a bicycle along the Han River (Evidence: \"몰라요\"). \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is lexical with a rating of 4 out of 5. The vocabulary used was generally appropriate for the context, but reliance on limited terms (e.g., \"자전거, 수영, 골프\") points to a lack of specific vocabulary for elaboration. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. Responses lacked logical connection in more complex questions, indicating difficulty in providing coherent narratives. The abrupt end with \"몰라요\" suggests a breakdown in organization. \nI recommend starting with the Module A2: Fundamental conversational phrases and basic narrative skills. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complex Sentence Formation: Encourage the student to practice combining sentences using conjunctions and relative clauses. 2. Detail Expansion: The student should work on elaborating answers with more descriptive language and vocabulary. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement Picture Narration Exercise: Have the student describe a series of images in detail to build narrative skills and vocabulary expansion. This will assist in enhancing coherence and fluency in more complex responses. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
