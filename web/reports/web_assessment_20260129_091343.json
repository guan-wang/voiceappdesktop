  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A1 level. You performed well during the Level-up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-up phase, where the student struggled to provide detailed responses to prompts. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is grammar with a rating of 3 out of 5. The student uses simple present tense correctly but fails to expand on ideas or use past tense effectively. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to connect ideas and provide coherent narratives, especially in Level-up. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on basic conversational skills and vocabulary expansion. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Lack of detail in responses (e.g., \"아님 몰라요\" indicates a failure to engage with the prompt). 2. Basic vocabulary usage (e.g., \"티미\" instead of \"취미\" shows a need for lexical refinement). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement \"Shadowing\" exercises where the student listens to and repeats simple dialogues to improve fluency and vocabulary usage. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
