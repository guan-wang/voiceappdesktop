  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to elaborate on their hobbies. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is generally clear, but there are minor issues with certain words. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to connect ideas and lacks logical operators in responses. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on expanding vocabulary and sentence structure (e.g., A2 Level Vocabulary Expansion). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Lexical Precision: The student should work on using correct and specific vocabulary (e.g., correcting \"자동도\" to \"자전거\"). 2. Coherence in Responses: Practice linking ideas with logical operators to improve discourse organization. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a \"Picture Narration\" exercise where the student describes a series of images related to their hobbies, encouraging them to use more complex sentences and vocabulary. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
