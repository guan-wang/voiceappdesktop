  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at B1 (Intermediate) level. You performed well during the Probe phase. The breakdown occurred during the Probe phase, specifically when discussing the impact of social media on communication. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 4 out of 5. The student demonstrates good fluency with minimal hesitation. Responses are generally coherent. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 3 out of 5. Ideas are generally linked, but transitions could be smoother, especially in more complex ideas. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on complex sentence structures and abstract vocabulary. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complex Sentence Structures: The student struggles with nested logic, as seen in their attempt to convey opinions in the Probe phase. 2. Specific Vocabulary Usage: The use of generic terms like '것들' instead of more specific vocabulary limits clarity. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a 'Shadowing' exercise where the student listens to and repeats complex sentences from native speakers, focusing on structure and vocabulary precision. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
