  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, particularly when the student was asked to express opinions and provide justifications. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 4 out of 5. The student demonstrates good fluency with minimal hesitation during the Warm-Up phase. However, there are noticeable pauses and hesitations during the Level-Up phase. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 3 out of 5. The student connects ideas but lacks the use of logical operators in more complex responses. \nI recommend starting with the A2 Level Grammar and Vocabulary Expansion module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complex Sentence Structures: Encourage the use of relative clauses and conditionals to express opinions and justifications. 2. Specific Vocabulary Usage: Work on replacing generic terms with more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and richness in responses. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement Shadowing Exercises where the student listens to and repeats complex sentences from native speakers to improve fluency and grammatical accuracy. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
