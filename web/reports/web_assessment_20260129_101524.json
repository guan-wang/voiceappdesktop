  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 (Elementary) level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student was asked to provide more detailed descriptions and narratives. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is generally clear, but some words may be mispronounced, affecting clarity. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to connect ideas smoothly, leading to fragmented responses. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on narrative skills and descriptive language (e.g., \"Describing Experiences\"). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Grammatical Range: Improve the use of noun forms and verb conjugations to avoid basic errors (e.g., \"투씨\" should be \"도시\"). 2. Lexical Precision: Encourage the use of more specific vocabulary instead of generic terms (e.g., \"자전거\" could be expanded to \"산악 자전거\" for specificity.) \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement \"Picture Narration\" exercises where the student describes a series of images to practice narrative skills and coherence in speech. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
