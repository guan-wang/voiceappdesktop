  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A1 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to provide a narrative response. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation was clear, but there were minor issues with intonation. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggled to connect ideas and provide a coherent narrative. \nI recommend starting with the Module focused on expanding vocabulary and narrative skills (e.g., describing experiences). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Difficulty in providing detailed responses (e.g., \"아, 몰라요. 죄송합니다.\" indicates a lack of narrative ability). 2. Limited vocabulary usage (e.g., using generic terms like \"수영, 자전거, 골프\" without elaboration). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement \"Picture Narration\" exercises where the student describes a series of images related to their hobbies or experiences to encourage narrative development and vocabulary expansion. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
