  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A1 level. You performed well during the Warm-up phase. The student struggled during the Warm-up phase, particularly with providing information about hobbies and personal experiences. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 2 out of 5. The student provided very short responses and showed hesitation, particularly when asked to elaborate on personal experiences. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. Responses lacked logical flow and connection to the questions asked, indicating difficulty in maintaining a coherent discourse. \nI recommend starting with the A1 - Basic Communication Skills module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Expand vocabulary related to personal interests and experiences. 2. Practice forming complete sentences to express thoughts. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Engage in Picture Narration exercises to describe images related to hobbies and daily activities. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
