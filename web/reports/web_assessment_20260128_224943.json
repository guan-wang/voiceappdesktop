  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-up phase, specifically when asked to elaborate on experiences related to swimming. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency with a rating of 3 out of 5. The student demonstrates moderate fluency with some hesitation, particularly when asked to elaborate. Immediate responses are given to simple questions, but longer prompts lead to pauses. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to maintain coherence in longer responses, often providing fragmented thoughts without clear connections. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on basic sentence structure and vocabulary expansion. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Verb Form Consistency: The student needs to practice using correct verb forms in context (e.g., \"자전거 타기\" instead of \"자전거 수영\"). 2. Sentence Structure: Focus on forming complete sentences and using conjunctions to connect ideas. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a Shadowing Exercise, where the student listens to and repeats longer sentences or dialogues to improve fluency and grammatical accuracy. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
