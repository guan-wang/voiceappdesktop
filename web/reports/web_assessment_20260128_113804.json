  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to provide detailed responses and complex sentence structures. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is generally clear, with minor issues that do not impede understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to connect ideas logically and provide cohesive responses. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on expanding vocabulary and constructing complex sentences (e.g., using conjunctions and relative clauses). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complex Sentence Construction: The student needs to practice using conjunctions to connect ideas (e.g., \"because,\" \"and,\" \"but\"). 2. Specific Vocabulary Use: Encourage the student to replace generic terms with more specific vocabulary (e.g., \"golf\" instead of \"골프\" without context). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a \"Picture Narration\" exercise where the student describes a series of images related to hobbies, encouraging them to use complex sentences and specific vocabulary. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
