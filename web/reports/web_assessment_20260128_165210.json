  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-up phase, particularly when discussing the last trip and the hypothetical scenario about starting a new company. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is clear, with minor errors that do not impede understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. Ideas are sometimes linked, but logical operators are often missing, leading to fragmented thoughts. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on expanding vocabulary and complex sentence structures (e.g., relative clauses, conjunctions). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complex Sentence Structures: The student struggles with combining ideas into more complex sentences (Evidence: \"사무실 일 더 좋아요. 회사 사람 있어.\"). 2. Specific Vocabulary Use: The student uses generic terms instead of more precise vocabulary (Evidence: \"큰 도시예요.\" instead of \"대도시\" or \"urban area\"). \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a 'Picture Narration' exercise where the student describes a series of images to practice using complex sentences and specific vocabulary. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
