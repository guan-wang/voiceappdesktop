  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to elaborate on their experiences. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is generally clear, with some minor issues that do not impede understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to connect ideas logically when asked to provide more detail. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on expanding vocabulary and sentence complexity (e.g., descriptive language). module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complex Sentence Structures: Encourage the use of relative clauses and conjunctions to enhance narrative quality. 2. Specific Vocabulary Usage: Work on replacing generic terms with more precise vocabulary to improve clarity and engagement. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement 'Picture Narration' exercises where the student describes a series of images to practice elaboration and coherence in their responses. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
