  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Level-Up phase. The breakdown occurred during the Level-Up phase, where the student struggled to elaborate on the Ice Festival. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is phonology with a rating of 4 out of 5. Pronunciation is generally clear, with minor errors that do not impede understanding. An area to focus on is coherence, rated at 2 out of 5. The student struggles to connect ideas and expand on topics, leading to abrupt ends in conversation. \nI recommend starting with the Module focusing on Level-Up skills, particularly narrative and descriptive tasks. module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Complexity in Sentence Structure: Encourage the use of relative clauses and cohesive devices to enhance narrative flow. 2. Lexical Precision: Work on expanding vocabulary beyond generic terms to include more specific and contextually appropriate words. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Implement a 'Picture Narration' exercise where the student describes a series of images related to a festival or event, encouraging them to use more complex sentences and vocabulary. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
