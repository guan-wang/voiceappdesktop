📱 ENABLE MICROPHONE ON YOUR PHONE - QUICK GUIDE
================================================

THE PROBLEM:
Mobile browsers block microphone access over HTTP.
You need HTTPS (even for local testing).

THE SOLUTION (3 Steps):
=======================

1️⃣ GENERATE SSL CERTIFICATE
   Run this in PowerShell:

   cd C:\Users\Guan\Projects\agents\korean_voice_tutor\web\backend
   .\setup_https_python.ps1

   This creates cert.pem and key.pem files.

2️⃣ RESTART SERVER
   
   .\stop_server.ps1
   .\start_server.ps1

   You should see: "🔒 HTTPS enabled"

3️⃣ ACCESS FROM PHONE WITH HTTPS

   Use HTTPS (note the 's'):
   https://192.168.45.151:7860

   You'll see a security warning - this is NORMAL for self-signed certs.
   
   On iOS: Tap "Show Details" → "visit this website"
   On Android: Tap "Advanced" → "Proceed to ... (unsafe)"

THAT'S IT! 🎉
The microphone permission prompt should now appear on your phone!
