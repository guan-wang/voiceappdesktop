  "verbal_summary": "Based on our conversation, I've assessed your Korean proficiency at A2 level. You performed well during the Warm-Up phase. The student struggled with elaboration and detail in responses, particularly during the Level-Up phase when asked to describe experiences in more depth. \nLet me break down the key areas: Your strongest area is fluency & interaction with a rating of 5 out of 10. The student can maintain a basic conversation and respond to simple questions but struggles with extended discourse and elaboration. An area to focus on is coherence & discourse management, rated at 4 out of 10. The student struggles with coherence and logical sequencing in responses, often providing disconnected phrases without clear connections. \nI recommend starting with the Basic Conversation Skills module. The top patterns to work on are: 1. Expand responses with more detail and examples. 2. Improve coherence in multi-turn conversations. \nFor practice, I suggest this exercise: Practice elaboration exercises by describing past experiences in detail. \nYou're making good progress! Keep practicing regularly.",
